# Distant Horizons for 1.12.2

## Description
This is my first mod — expect things to be broken, unfinished, or missing.  
**Feel free to contribute!**

### Best Experience
- ⚠ Due to slow world/LOD generation in-game, it is recommended to pre-generate your world. For example, you can use [Chunk-Pregenerator](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunkpregenerator) (it will pregen LOD also)
- In modded worlds, I recommend setting the LOD distance to **96**

## Credits

- **Distant Horizons Team** – for creating the original mod  
- **DarkShadow44** – for the 1.7.10 fork of Distant Horizons  


## Incompatibilities
- ❌ **Not compatible with Optifine** (unless someone create PR for it) use [Celeritas](https://git.taumc.org/embeddedt/celeritas) instead
- ⚠ **Valkyrie's fog** Disable Valkyrie's fog in config
